# SmoothStudy.ai - MVP

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20development-blue)

SmoothStudy.ai is your AI-powered study partner, designed to make learning smarter, faster, and more effective. We're building a suite of high-impact tools that provide instant value, integrate into daily study routines, and build powerful, lasting learning habits.

## The Problem

Students today are overwhelmed with information. Drowning in lecture notes, textbooks, and PDFs, they spend more time managing materials than actually learning them. Traditional study methods are time-consuming, passive, and often inefficient at building long-term retention.

## Our Solution

SmoothStudy.ai uses artificial intelligence to automate the most tedious parts of studying. From summarising content to generating practice exams, our platform acts as a 24/7 personal tutor, helping you understand, retain, and apply knowledge with unparalleled efficiency.
